### Project Title
Analyze A/B Test Results

by Livia Mendes

### Description
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

In this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### File used
- ab_data.csv
- countries.csv

### Files
- Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb
- Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html
- readme.md

## Conclusions

The findings evidenced that I have no data to support that the new website is better. With what I found it is possible that both the new and old pages have an close to equal conversion rate.

Further, the experiment only took 22 days. Probably not long enough to see any change or difference in conversion rates.

Ideally this experiment needs to run for a longer period of time in order to have more accurate results.
